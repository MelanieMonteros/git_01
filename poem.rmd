## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  
  
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
I went to turn the grass once after one   
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.    
    
The dew was gone that made his blade so keen    
Before I came to view the levelled scene.    
    
I looked for him behind an isle of trees;   
  
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sun was shining on the sea,    
Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make    
The billows smooth and bright--    
And this was odd, because it was    
The middle of the night.    
    
The moon was shining sulkily,    
Because she thought the sun    
Had got no business to be there    
After the day was done--    
"It's very rude of him," she said,    
"To come and spoil the fun!"    

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the Harlem streets where dreams unfold,    
Whispers of jazz in the midnight cold.    
Langston's voice, a river's flow,    
Through verses deep, the truth would grow.    
    
A weary blues, a weary soul,    
In every rhythm, a story told.    
In rivers of rhyme, he'd navigate,    
The struggles faced, the love, the hate.    
    
Jazz-kissed nights and freedom's call,    
Langston's pen, a beacon tall.    
From the weary night to the morning sun,    
His verses danced, each word a run.    
    
A dream deferred, a crystal stair,    
In Harlem's heartbeat, Hughes would share.    
Through syncopated lines, a melody,    
Of life's complexity and sweet mystery.    
    
So here we stand, in Hughes' embrace,    
A poetic journey, a timeless grace.    
In every verse, his spirit springs,    
Echoing through the soul, where freedom sings.
