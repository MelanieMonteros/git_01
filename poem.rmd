In the Harlem streets where dreams unfold,    
Whispers of jazz in the midnight cold.    
Langston's voice, a river's flow,    
Through verses deep, the truth would grow.    
    
A weary blues, a weary soul,    
In every rhythm, a story told.    
In rivers of rhyme, he'd navigate,    
The struggles faced, the love, the hate.    
    
Jazz-kissed nights and freedom's call,    
Langston's pen, a beacon tall.    
From the weary night to the morning sun,    
His verses danced, each word a run.    
    
A dream deferred, a crystal stair,    
In Harlem's heartbeat, Hughes would share.    
Through syncopated lines, a melody,    
Of life's complexity and sweet mystery.    
    
So here we stand, in Hughes' embrace,    
A poetic journey, a timeless grace.    
In every verse, his spirit springs,    
Echoing through the soul, where freedom sings.
